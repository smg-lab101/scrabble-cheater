# scrabble-cheater
This Schrabble Cheater was a project for school done in cooperation with @TahroO and @vivigl

Concepts involved: Creating our own hashtable collection, recursive methods to create string permutation

Additional methods in the dictionary class that we used while creating the program can be found on the bottom of the file!

(note) I decided to leave comments at a minimum following a clean and understandable coding practice
